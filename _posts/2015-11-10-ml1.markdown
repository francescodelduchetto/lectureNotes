Machine learning is the study and construction of algorithms that are able
to learn from example data or past experience.

### Well-posed learning problem

If the learning problem is **well posed** then: 

*a computer program is said to **learn** from **experience E** with respect to
a **class of tasks T** and **performance measure P** if its performance at tasks 
**T**, as measured by **P**, improves with experience **E**.*

### Example of learning problems

* [Collaborative FIltering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering)
* [Imitation learning in video games](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/14/ai-research-artificial-intelligence-game-characters)
* [Spam filtering](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/google-says-ai-catches-99-9-percent-gmail-spam/)
* Cheque reading

### Programming with data
We are searching for an **adaptive**, **robust** and **fault tolerant** 
system. In order 
to obtain this we need to go through some automated learning mechanism because
the *rule-based* implementations are:

* difficult to program
* brittle, because it miss many edge-cases
* difficult to mantain
* often doesn't work well (e.g. OCR)

### Supervised Learning


$$y = f(x)$$
