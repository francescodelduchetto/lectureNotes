#**Principle Component Analysis (PCA)**

##*Motivation*:
It's hard to visualize and correlate data with high dimensions ($$>3$$ dimensions). So PCA is used to reduce the data dimesnions that keeps most of the information about the original data.

##**PCA**:
Orthogonal projection of the data onto a lower-dimension linear space that;

- Maximizes the variance of the projected data
- Minimizes the mean square difference between the data points and the projections 

##**PCA Applications**:
- Data Visulaization
- Data Compression
- Noise Reduction

##**PCA Vectors**:
find $$k$$ vectors $$u_1, u_2,\dots, u_k$$ onto which to project the data, so as to minimize the projection error.

- Originate from the center of mass.
- Principle component 1 points in the direction of the largest variance.
- Each subsequent principle component is orthogonal to the previous ones, and points in the directions of largest variance of the residual subspace.

##**PCA Algorithm**:
- *Given*: Training set: $$x^1, x^2,\dots, x^n$$ 
- *Goal*: Reduce data from $$n$$-dimensions to $$k$$-dimensions 
- Preprocessing (Mean normalization and feature scaling if needed):
	1. Mean normalization steps:
		- Calculate the mean of data $$\Rightarrow \frac{1}{m} \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{m=k} x_i $$ 
		- Subtract the mean from each column vector $$x_i$$ in the data matrix
	2. Calculate the covariance matrix $$\Rightarrow \Sigma = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x^i) * (x^i)^T $$
	3. Extract U from [u,s,v] = svd $$\Sigma$$ using Matlab or Octave.	
	4. Take the first *k* principle component vectors (eigen vectors) from the matrix U.
