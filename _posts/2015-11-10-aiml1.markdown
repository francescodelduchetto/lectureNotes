## Agents and Environments

An **agent** is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its **environment**
throgh **sensors** and acting upon that environment through **actuators**.

![Agent and environment](http://condor.depaul.edu/slytinen/480w13/l1/agent.jpg)

### Rational Agents

We can use a fixed **performance measure** to evaluate the environment 
sequence. This measure usually *reward* the agent when it does actions that 
have good effects on the environment and *penalize* it otherwise.

A **rational agent** chooses whichever action maximizes the **expected value**
of the performance measure given the percept sequence to date.

$$\text{Rational} \neq \text{Omniscient}$$

$$\text{Rational} \neq \text{Clairvoyant}$$

$$\text{Rational} \neq \text{Successful}$$  

$$\text{Rational} \Rightarrow \text{Exploration, Learning, Autonomy}$$

### Functions and Agent Programs

The **agent function** maps from percept histories to actions:

$$f : P^* \rightarrow A$$

In an *idealistic implementation* we can have a table that lists all the 
possible percept histories of the agent with the associated action to execute.
This approach is unfeasable because of the huge size of the resulting table.

A more *pratical implementation* is the use of a program that keep track 
of the sequence of percepts and choose the best action for each new percept.

The **agent program** runs on the physical architecture to produce $$f$$.

### PEAS
To design a rational agent, we must specify the **task environment**:

* **Performance Measure**
* **Environment**
* **Actuators**
* **Sensors**

### Environment's Features
The agent environment can be:
* Totally or partially observable
* Deterministic, non-deterministic, stochastic or strategic 
* Episodic or sequential
* Static, dynamic or semidynamic
* Discrete or continuos
* Single-angent or multi-agent

The environment influences the agent design.

### Agent types
